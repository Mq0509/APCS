QCC
------------------------------------------------
* We first tried to initialize an ArrayList and set the size to max(data)+1, but
frequency remained size 0. Instead, we made a for loop that added 0s to the array.
*Max is non-static so we could not test it in the driver without making it static.
*We made frequency not private so that we could test the constructor.
- We had to change a for loop for(Integer i : al2) to for(int index = 0; index < sp2._frequency.size(); index++ )
because prior, it wasn't working as anticipated - it was using the data list to find indexes in the frequency ArrayList
but we wanted to iterate through the frequency list through each index independently
