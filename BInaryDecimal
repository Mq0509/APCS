HOW TO CONVERT BINARY TO DECIMAL
Starting at the rightmost digit, the value assigned to it is 2^(n-1), n being how far the digit is from the lst digit. If the digit is a '1', you add its value to the sum and '0'has no value. The sum of all the '1' values is the decimal.

HOW TO CONVERT DECIMAL TO BINARY
Take the biggest power of 2 from the decimal. Take it again from the remainder. Repeat until no more powers of 2 ca be taken away. Starting from the right side, write 0s until the exponent power matches the one for a '1' value(the powers of 2 taken).
