WHAT THIS DEMO SHOWS
We drew squares, ellipses, and triangles as our cursor moved. The shading of the shapes can be changed from black
to white if the user holds onto the left mousepad.

WHY YOU CARE
It can be a basic part of our final project, as these basic features can allow us to make shapes and utilize mouse
movement and state.
