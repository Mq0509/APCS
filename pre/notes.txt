HW05 -- How Was Your Summer?/Prework/Notes
2021-09-27




HelloWorld Notes 
I have never used Java before, so the starter of the code was really new and interesting. 
I never had to use semicolons for every line too, and later on, I would have errors because I forgot to use semicolons.

Date and Time Notes 
I had difficulties doing the code starters because it was my first time. When I was doing this, 
I found all the lines of System.out.print to be really inefficient. 

Nothing was really noticable, the only small thing I had to fix was the syntax.

Methods Notes
The syntax for if was very different. 

Value Methods
The syntax was hard to get used to, Racket did not really need symbols like ==. 

Loops
I stil do not understand the enhanced for loop. The most difficult part of this was just getting the concept. 

Arrays
I had a difficult time writing the array statements, often when I try to update a array, it wouldn't run.
