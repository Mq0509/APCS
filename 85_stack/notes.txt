QCC
-It is really important to import arraylists and linked lists when needed. Otherwise, many cannot find symbol errors will pop up.
-If we use linked lists or arraylists, a size variable is no longer needed because arraylists and linkedlists will automatically update size.
-Do they have the same run times for these methods (according to Piazza they do)

DISCO
-It is necessary to check if a list is empty or not before popping or peeking because it is not done for us by ArrayList and LinkedList.
