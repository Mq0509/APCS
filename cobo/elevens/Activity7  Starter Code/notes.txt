1. 9 cards (arranged in 3 x 3), the main deck, the garbage pile (used cards)
    private Deck mainDeck;
    private Deck garbageDeck;
    private Deck nineDeck;

2.
  1. Make and shuffle a mainDeck.
  2. Remove cards from mainDeck and place them in nineDeck
  3. Check for 11s
    - Find pairs
    - If there are no pairs, find 3 consecutive face-value cards
    - If that doesn't work, game ends.
  4. If there are pairs or 3 consecutive face-value cards, remove them from
     nineDeck and place them in garbageDeck
  5. Replace the cards you removed by taking from the mainDeck
  6. Repeat steps 3-5 until there is 1 or 0 cards left in the nineDeck

3. No, it does not.

4.

  a. The dealMyCards method is called in the constructor and in the newGame() method

  b. In the anotherPlayIsPossible() method and in the isLegal() method

  c. Returned list -> 0, 1, 3, 6, 7

  d.

    public static void printCards (ElevensBoard board) {
      List<Integer> cIndexes = board.cardIndexes();

      for (int i = 0; i < cIndexes.size(); i++) {
        System.out.println(board.get(cIndexes.get(i)));
      }

    }

  e. Both of the methods because it'll make it easier to find indexes with Cards. Both of these methods
     need this function because they need to be able to compare Cards.
