Activity 9 was difficult because the descriptions for the methods we had to code

were confusing and the questions asking about abstract methods were confusing as well.

We read the correct code for Activity 9 in the Activity 10 folder and tried to understand it.

We skipped the optional activities (5, 10, 11).

Everything else went fine.
