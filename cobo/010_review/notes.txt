Activity 1
1a) public static double sentimentVal( String word )
1b) It requires a String. If you do not put a String input, it will throw an
    error (incorrect type).
1c) It returns a double.

2)  sentimentVal("accidental") -> -2.07
    sentimentVal("account") -> 0.64
    sentimentVal("acceptable") -> -0.12

3a) It will compile because "warm" is a string and the parameter is a string.
3b) It will not compile because 0.5 is a double, not a string, so it does not
    parameter requirements.
3c) It will not compile because the parameter is one string, not two.

Activity 2
4)  In totalSentiment, I used textToString to convert a file into strings. I then
    turned these strings into an array using split. I then used a for loop to iterate
    through all the words and added their sentiment value into the final answer.
5a) Not really because negative sentiment should not impact postitive sentiment.
5b) It should negate the negative sentiments or the positive ones, so all sentiment
    are kept track of.
6)  The student has no if statement catching totalSentiments greater or equal to 15.
    The greatest totalSentiment this student would be able to catch is 14, which is
    the first if statement. Logically, the greater the totalSentiments, the greater
    the starRating, but anything totalSentiment greater than 14 would return 0 in
    this case, since these totalSentiment values are only caught by the last else
    statement.
