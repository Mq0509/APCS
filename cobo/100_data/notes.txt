QCC
- A .jar file will be ignored by the git.ignore file on Github. To work around this,
  you must do git add -f fileName

Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism's CSV FLOW:
We looked over two datasets via Spreadsheets about the number and causes of death as well as cars being auctioned.
We looked through the first row to see what each number meant. Then, we interpretted the data.
To count the number of records, we looked at the number of rows. 

TRUBZ
- We originally had some problems with compiling and running the Welcome files, but
  we fortunately got help from Raven Tang on piazza.
- Had to manually do git add -f sinbad.jar in order to make sure the .jar file was
  on the repo.
