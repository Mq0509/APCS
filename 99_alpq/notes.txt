DISCO
- Static methods in interfaces must have an implementation. This makes sense
  because a static method should have the same implementation across all classes
  that implement it.
  - Extension of the above: the method can't be both static and abstract (for the same reason)

QCC
- If we were to use Strings instead of ints as the values in the ArrayList, how would
  we determine priority? How could we generalize our ArrayPriorityQueue?
