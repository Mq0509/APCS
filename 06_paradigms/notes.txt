Scheme: (display "Hello, world!")
Netlogo: output-show "Hello, world!"
Python: print("Hello, world")

Q3: Our group all used print and display for Python and Scheme. 

Q4: Our Netlogo code was different, my teammate, Salaj, used print "Hello World", while I used output-show. When I checked the Netlogo dictionary, I realized that
Netlogo has many different ways to print a text.
